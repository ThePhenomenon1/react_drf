# react_drf
This is a beautifully impactful fullstack; a React frontend using Typescript with a Django REST framework backend. The React app fetches data from the Django API and displays it.
The frontend, garnished with Tailwind CSS, is efficiently managed by Vite, an application runner which boasts inbuilt functions such as Hot Module loading.
